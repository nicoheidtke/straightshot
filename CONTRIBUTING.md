# Contributing to straightshot

First off, thank you for considering contributing to straightshot. 

## Project Status

**This project is currently a prototype and is not production-ready.**

It is in the early stages of development, and the primary goal at this point is for me to learn something and have some fun.
I try to build out the core features and stabilize the API though. 

### Not Seeking Contributions Currently

At this stage, I am not actively seeking contributions. The project structure, code, and features are still subject to significant change. 

### Testing

The test suite is currently non-existing. If this project ever matures into something more, I'll add test coverage.

### Feedback and Suggestions

Even though I'm not looking for code contributions, I welcome feedback, bug reports, and suggestions. If you have an idea or find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub.

Thank you for your understanding!
