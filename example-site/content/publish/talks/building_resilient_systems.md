# Building Resilient Systems in a Distributed World

*Presented at DistributedConf 2025 in Berlin, Germany*

## Talk Abstract

In today's cloud-native world, failures aren't just possibleâ€”they're inevitable. This talk explores patterns and practices for building systems that can withstand the chaos of distributed environments. We'll cover circuit breakers, bulkheads, timeouts, and backoff strategies, along with real-world examples of how these patterns can be implemented in modern architectures.

## Key Topics Covered

- The fallacies of distributed computing in 2025
- Resilience vs. fault tolerance: understanding the difference
- Implementing circuit breakers in microservices
- Designing for partial availability
- Chaos engineering: breaking things on purpose
- Observability as a resilience enabler

## Code Examples

```java
// Example circuit breaker implementation
public class CircuitBreaker {
    private final long timeout;
    private final long retryTimePeriod;
    private long lastFailureTime;
    private int failureCount;
    private State state;
    
    public enum State {
        CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
    }
    
    public CircuitBreaker(long timeout, long retryTimePeriod) {
        this.timeout = timeout;
        this.retryTimePeriod = retryTimePeriod;
        this.state = State.CLOSED;
        this.failureCount = 0;
        this.lastFailureTime = 0;
    }
    
    public <T> T execute(Supplier<T> operation) throws Exception {
        if (state == State.OPEN) {
            if (System.currentTimeMillis() - lastFailureTime > retryTimePeriod) {
                // Move to half-open state and try the operation
                state = State.HALF_OPEN;
            } else {
                throw new CircuitBreakerOpenException("Circuit breaker is open");
            }
        }
        
        try {
            T result = operation.get();
            
            if (state == State.HALF_OPEN) {
                // Success, circuit is closed
                reset();
            }
            
            return result;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            handleFailure();
            throw e;
        }
    }
    
    private void handleFailure() {
        failureCount++;
        lastFailureTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        
        if (failureCount >= timeout || state == State.HALF_OPEN) {
            state = State.OPEN;
        }
    }
    
    private void reset() {
        state = State.CLOSED;
        failureCount = 0;
    }
}
```

## Q&A from the Session

**Q: How do you balance resilience with development speed?**  
A: Start with the critical paths in your system. Not every component needs the same level of resilience engineering.

**Q: Is there a place for chaos engineering in smaller organizations?**  
A: Absolutely. The scale might be different, but the principles remain valuable even for smaller systems.
