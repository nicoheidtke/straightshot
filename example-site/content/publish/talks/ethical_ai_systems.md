# Building Ethical AI Systems: Responsibility in the Age of Automation

*Keynote presented at AI Ethics Summit 2025 in Toronto, Canada*

## Talk Abstract

As AI systems become more deeply integrated into critical aspects of society, from healthcare to criminal justice, the ethical implications of these systems demand our attention. This talk explores the current landscape of AI ethics, practical approaches to building more fair and transparent systems, and the responsibility that falls on developers, organizations, and society.

## Key Topics Covered

- Beyond buzzwords: what "ethical AI" really means in practice
- Techniques for detecting and mitigating bias in machine learning models
- Transparency and explainability in high-stakes AI systems
- Balancing innovation with responsibility
- The role of regulation and self-governance in AI development
- Case studies of ethical challenges in real-world AI systems

## Slides

[slides: ethical-ai-2025]

## Demo: Bias Detection Tool

During the talk, I demonstrated a tool for detecting potential bias in machine learning models:

```python
# Example code from the bias detection demo
import fairlearn.metrics as metrics

# Evaluate model for demographic parity
demographic_parity = metrics.demographic_parity_difference(
    y_true=y_test,
    y_pred=model_predictions,
    sensitive_features=sensitive_attributes
)

# Evaluate model for equalized odds
equalized_odds = metrics.equalized_odds_difference(
    y_true=y_test,
    y_pred=model_predictions,
    sensitive_features=sensitive_attributes
)

print(f"Demographic parity difference: {demographic_parity:.4f}")
print(f"Equalized odds difference: {equalized_odds:.4f}")

# Visualize the disparities across groups
metrics.plot_group_metric_comparison(
    metric=metrics.true_positive_rate,
    y_true=y_test,
    y_pred=model_predictions,
    sensitive_features=sensitive_attributes
)
```

## Ethical Framework Proposed

I introduced a practical framework for ethical AI development consisting of five pillars:

1. **Inclusivity**: Ensuring diverse perspectives in all stages of development
2. **Transparency**: Making AI systems explainable to appropriate stakeholders
3. **Accountability**: Establishing clear responsibility for AI outcomes
4. **Fairness**: Testing for and mitigating biases systematically
5. **Safety**: Designing systems that prioritize human welfare

## Q&A Highlights

**Q: How can small teams with limited resources meaningfully incorporate ethical considerations?**  
A: Start with a simple checklist approach that examines potential impacts and stakeholders. Even a small effort to consider ethical implications is better than none.

**Q: Who should be accountable when an AI system produces harmful results?**  
A: Accountability must exist at multiple levels - from developers to deploying organizations to regulatory bodies. Clear documentation of decision-making processes is essential.
