# About Me

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm the author of this site, which is focused on technology and software development.

## What I Do

I specialize in designing and building scalable, resilient systems that can handle millions of requests. My work spans across various domains, including:

- Backend development with Go, Rust, and Python
- Distributed systems architecture
- Performance optimization
- Technical leadership and mentoring

## My Journey

I started my career as a web developer in 2015, working primarily with JavaScript and PHP. Over the years, I've evolved into a systems engineer with a focus on reliability and performance. I've worked at startups and large tech companies, each experience adding new perspectives to my approach to software development.

In 2023, I joined TechCorp as a Senior Software Engineer, where I lead the backend infrastructure team. Our work focuses on building the next generation of cloud-native services that power the company's main products.

## Beyond Coding

When I'm not in front of a computer, you might find me:

- Hiking in the mountains
- Reading science fiction novels
- Experimenting with new cooking recipes
- Contributing to open source projects

I believe in lifelong learning and regularly share my knowledge through blog posts, conference talks, and community engagement.
